### Version 3

While the framework exists since 1999, the current version 3 got completely rewritten in 2016 by passionate members of 
the community, using the object-oriented capabilities of the Oracle database to make it more consistent with other
*Unit frameworks (e.g. JUnit for Java). 
  
This had significant impact on the syntax and the way the framework can be used.
